ACID Properties


What is ACID?
        ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.


1- Atomicity
        Atomicity means a transaction is all-or-nothing either all its operations succeed, or none are applied. If any part fails, the entire transaction is rolled back to keep the database consistent.


2-Consistency
        Consistency in transactions means that the database must remain in a valid state before and after a transaction.


3-isolation
        Isolation ensures that transactions run independently without affecting each other. Changes made by one transaction are not visible to others until they are committed.


4-Durability
        Durability ensures that once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanently saved, even if the system fails. The data is stored in non-volatile memory, so the database can recover to its last committed state without losing data.


The ACID properties, in totality, provide a mechanism to ensure the correctness and consistency of a database in a way such that each transaction is a group of operations that acts as a single unit, produces consistent results, acts in isolation from other operations, and updates that it makes are durably stored.
